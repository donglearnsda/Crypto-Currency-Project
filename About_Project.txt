1. Business model
K Enterprise is a crypto wallet (K) business with millions of users worldwide
gender. Each user can have 1 or more wallets, each wallet contains 1 or more cryptos
currency. Users who register to use the K platform will have to import 1 or more of their wallets
into the platform. Since it is a blockchain platform, the user's identity does not need to be declared,
however, information about the device they use to log in is recorded, including what device, background
what platform (web/mobile), what operating system, IP address (geographical location of collectable IP)...
Platform K as a playground for these people to use their wallets to exchange for cryptocurrencies
in their wallet (swap). Users exchange cryptos because they believe their cryptos will change
prices will increase in the future. There are many crypto currencies, but they are ranked in
2 types: stable coin and alt coin. Stable coins are crypto currencies anchored at real money prices such as
USD, YEN, RMB or gold, while Alt coins are floating crypto currencies
such as Bitcoin.
For each transaction, the customer exchanges 1 coin for another based on the value
temporary of that coin, for example, coin A at that time is worth 1$/dong, it will be exchanged for 2 coins B
priced at $0.50/dong. Wallet K will collect 2% of the transaction fee, paid = VND exchanged (VND B)
